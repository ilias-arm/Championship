# Championship

A Java project that manages a "Championsip". 

In the main class we create some teams and the games between them.
Then we calculate the points of each team, depending on the matches we added.

Finally we calculate and print the final standing of the "Championship".

Each sport (football, basketball) has a different way for calculating the points and a different final standing.

All comment are in greek!
